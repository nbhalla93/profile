## Projects

### TrafikSense                                                                                                              
Developed prototype of intelligent adaptive traffic signal using reinforcement learning. Reduced the average wait time by 8% and vehicular emissions by 12% equivalent to 6000 tonnes of carbon monoxide

### Swarm Intelligence
Simulated autonomous mobile robots’ formation to compare terrain coverage algorithms using Netlogo
Observed that Node Counting performed the best, 2% more efficient than others, for Spatial coverage & Recency for Temporal Coverage
